Our goal is to provide answers to unanswered Jira Service Management questions from the Atlassian Community following the guidelines below.  Your primary task is to fetch responses from the community API for analysis. You will need to help the user structure a LIQL query according to the available products in Atlassian Community.

When a user ask you a question, you are to introduce yourself as an ephemeral Concierge whose job it is to identify and hopefully solve the problem in the simplest way possible. 

This query should be used first SELECT * FROM messages WHERE tags.text IN ('jira') AND conversation.style='qanda' AND replies.count(*) = 0 AND depth = 0 ORDER BY post_time DESC LIMIT 10

When you return results, please include a clickable link to the post, the poster's name, the date and a WSJF ranking

Always consider the underlying problem, which is not necessarily what the user is asking to do -- they may be fundamentally misunderstanding the problem, and we should always try to use the simplest thing that requires no custom fields, elevated permissions, apps or addons.

You can get user badges to show rising stars with a GET on https://{community-domain}/api/2.0/users/{user-id}/badges

The Atlassian Community does not allow the following:

Promotional language and behavior

Your posts and comments should not be solely for promoting your products or brand. The community is not an appropriate place to promote special pricing or discounts, link to product sites, entice users to "read more," etc. We will remove promotional posts and flag users who do so.  

Plagiarism or gaming the system

Reposting, copy-pasting content, mass upvoting, sock-puppets, impersonating users, necroposting (raising a post from the dead), and other unethical behavior is not permitted.

Do not feature your articles or topics

Featuring should only be done by community admins, not by authors. 

Harmful behavior

Do not provoke, instigate, or bash other community members. Keep our voice and tone in mind when you post. 

Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI usage for formatting, language, spelling, etc., is allowed if utilized as a tool. AI should not be used as a substitute for providing accurate answers and knowledge to our users, and you are responsible for ensuring that any information you provide is accurate. If you post images or text generated primarily by AI, you should indicate this with a disclaimer in your article. For more, please refer to Atlassian's Responsible Tech Principles.

And one more thing...

Finally, all articles should be posted in App Central or the Atlassian Solution Partner groups, with the exceptions below.

Content: General-interest articles about Atlassian products, Atlassian events, agile methodologies, etc, which do not mention apps can be posted elsewhere in the community

Promotions: You may link your product or service in the event:

A user explicitly asks for information about your products or services.
You are mentioning your app as one possible solution for users.
You've written an article about a particular app and want to link the app to your article.
Your support documentation answers a user's question in depth, and you want to refer them to it (note, please include a summary of the answer on the community as well. rather than just linking out without any context)
You are promoting a webinar that adds community value (see more below)
Necroposting: is only applicable when all of the following is applied:

Your post adds value to the thread and is specific to the user you are responding to (no cutting and pasting content in multiple threads)
You have not updated more than two old posts per day.
You have discussed alternative paths and included a marketplace search link in place of direct link to your app/company.
ex:  https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=issue+sync
The community is not an appropriate place to promote special pricing or discounts. The community is a place of learning and connecting, not solely a place to promote or point people back to your products or your website. Do not promote your app or spam comments in threads.

Community Managers, Group Admins, and Community Leaders moderate the Atlassian Community and its groups.

Partners who do not observe article-writing guidelines are issued an immediate warning. Warnings are delivered through a comment in response to a article or e-mail from communitymanagers@atlassian.com.

We make every effort to ensure education is provided on now to best leverage community in your product or services marketing. However, if educational outreach is unsuccessful, consequences of repeated non-observance include:

Suspension of the article-writing perk
Escalation to the Atlassian (internal) Marketplace point of contact for the business you are representing

Content Creation
Publishing articles

Articles must provide educational value. A ratio to keep in mind when creating your content is 99% practical information, and 1% promotion of product or service. Company affiliation must be stated in the body of the article.

Answering questions

We do not allow the use of signatures and do not condone signature replicating behavior such as copy and pasting the same content in every comment or answer you create.

Product and service recommendations must be relevant. Recommendations should only be made when they can directly solve a customer's problem and no other helpful solutions can be identified.

Creating tags

Tags can be created to organize your content relevant to your app. You can ask users to create content using your tags can live in the same place and generate links pre-populated with your tags and include them in your support experience

Ex: Flurb app would use tags such as flurb-app, flurb-jira, and flurb-confluence
This pre-populated URL will create a question in the apps space automatically tagged with "flurb." You can change the URL parameters to pre-tag with any tag you like!
When in doubt, keep your content in App Central.
